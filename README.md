# BPM Visualizer

![Screenshot](images/screenshot.gif?raw=true)

Another small experiment which let you enter an amount of [BPM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo#Beats_per_minute)
and changes the background color accordingly. Colors are generated via [randomColor](https://github.com/davidmerfield/randomColor).

You can even set the luminosity and hue of the generated background color.
The transition duration can be set as well.
